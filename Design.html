                                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                        As part of a collaborative team of volunteer students, I worked on designing a website 
                                        aimed at providing chemistry educators with a platform to easily access and upload 
                                        teaching materials, research, and resources. The goal was to create an intuitive and 
                                        efficient user experience that streamlined the way educators interact with the site, 
                                        making it easier for them to share and retrieve valuable resources.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                        My personal responsibilities included: prototype design, data collection and analysis, 
                                        and style/UX choices. My first responsibility was designing a wireframe to determine 
                                        potential website navigation, appearance, and color palettes. From there, we gathered 
                                        feedback from our client as well as responses from potential users. Using this feedback, 
                                        we adjusted the navigation and appearance accordingly. My final role was to provide feedback 
                                        on the style and UX of the site, including minor alterations to the color palette and 
                                        spacing of items on the page.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                        By the end of the project, we successfully developed a fully functional website that received 
                                        positive feedback from educators. The website simplified the process of resource sharing and 
                                        improved overall collaboration in the educational community.

                                    In today's digital age, transitioning to digital platforms offers enhanced accessibility and a cleaner user experience. 
                                    However, I've observed that as the transition to digital became mainstream, many restaurants face challenges in 
                                    adapting their menus for mobile devices, leading to issues with readability, outdated designs, and poor mobile 
                                    optimization.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                                    Driven by these observations, I undertook a project to design a more intuitive mobile menu interface, adaptable for 
                                    both web and app platforms. My design prioritizes seamless navigation, enhanced readability, and a user-centered 
                                    experience. A key benefit of this digital approach is the flexibility to present content without the spatial limitations 
                                    of traditional paper menus, allowing for a richer and more adaptable user experience.

                                        I designed the business cards for the company Gem State Retractable Screens. 
                                        The goal of the business cards was to make the company name and employee name 
                                        easily recognizable, clearly convey contact information, and align with the company's 
                                        established brand aesthetic.

                                        In designing the business cards, the goal was to incorporate the brand's color palette 
                                        of blue, white, and yellow, enhancing both recognizability and cohesion. A vertical layout 
                                        was chosen to distinguish the card from standard business cards and to make better use of 
                                        the available space. Considering that the primary client base is people in their 50s or 
                                        older, an easy-to-read typeface and a simple decorative gradient were selected to improve 
                                        readability.

                                        The above poster was created to inform new GIMM cohorts, in a lighthearted manner, 
                                        about the rules and etiquette of 'ducking.' In GIMM, it is part of the culture to 
                                        leave and hide ducks; however, as the practice has grown in popularity, 
                                        the need for guidance has become apparent. My goal was to communicate proper conduct, 
                                        address unasked questions, and provide visual examples of what is and isn't appropriate.
