                                            Microchip Makers is a 4-minute, Schoolhouse Rock-style animation created for Boise State University's 
                                            MER Institute to support outreach in K-12 schools.

                                            The creation of Microchip Makers was a collaborative process involving myself and two other animators. 
                                            My responsibilities included creating storyboards, backgrounds, assets, and frame-by-frame animations. 
                                            We worked closely with our music composer to develop initial storyboards, as well as to define the tone 
                                            and style of the animation. Once the initial storyboards were completed, we produced our first animatic 
                                            to accompany a rough version of the song. From that point on, we alternated responsibilities, creating 
                                            backgrounds, frame-by-frame animations, and assets. Within a few weeks, the animation was completed.
                                        </p>

                                            One of our initial challenges was learning to collaborate effectively on an animation project of this 
                                            scale within a tight deadline. Though experienced in our respective areas, we quickly adapted by establishing 
                                            a streamlined workflow that allowed us to work efficiently as a team. Given the one-month timeline, we 
                                            coordinated closely on tasks like research, character design, and storyboarding to stay on track. Midway 
                                            through production, we realized additional time was needed to achieve our quality standards. After discussing 
                                            with our client, we secured an extension, enabling us to deliver a polished, high-quality animation that met 
                                            both our expectations and those of our client.

                                        Pursuit of Time was a collaborative project to create an interactive comic. 
                                        Each team member illustrated their own section, and I also handled the opening and 
                                        closing animations for the project.

                                        music from the game in reverse throughout the trailer.

                                                As part of a collaborative team of volunteer students, I worked on designing a website 
                                                aimed at providing chemistry educators with a platform to easily access and upload 
                                                teaching materials, research, and resources. The goal was to create an intuitive and 
                                                efficient user experience that streamlined the way educators interact with the site, 
                                                making it easier for them to share and retrieve valuable resources.
                                            </p>

                                                My personal responsibilities included: prototype design, data collection and analysis, 
                                                and style/UX choices. My first responsibility was designing a wireframe to determine 
                                                potential website navigation, appearance, and color palettes. From there, we gathered 
                                                feedback from our client as well as responses from potential users. Using this feedback, 
                                                we adjusted the navigation and appearance accordingly. My final role was to provide feedback 
                                                on the style and UX of the site, including minor alterations to the color palette and 
                                                spacing of items on the page.

                                                By the end of the project, we successfully developed a fully functional website that received 
                                                positive feedback from educators. The website simplified the process of resource sharing and 
                                                improved overall collaboration in the educational community.

                                                I designed the business cards for the company Gem State Retractable Screens.

                                                In designing the business cards, the goal was to incorporate the brand's color palette 
                                                of blue, white, and yellow, enhancing both recognizability and cohesion. A vertical layout 
                                                was chosen to distinguish the card from standard business cards and to make better use of 
                                                the available space. Considering that the primary client base is people in their 50s or 
                                                older, an easy-to-read typeface and a simple decorative gradient were selected to improve 
                                                readability.

                                            The poster here was created to inform new GIMM cohorts, in a lighthearted manner, 
                                            about the rules and etiquette of 'ducking.' In GIMM, it is part of the culture to 
                                            leave and hide ducks; however, as the practice has grown in popularity, 
                                            the need for guidance has become apparent. My goal was to communicate proper conduct, 
                                            address unasked questions, and provide visual examples of what is and isn't appropriate.
